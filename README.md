### üìå Project Overview
Automated approval workflows across departments to reduce paper usage and enhance document traceability. The automation initiative increased efficiency, accountability, and transparency while significantly lowering printing-related costs and promoting sustainability.

**Situation:**  
At the Court of Accounts of Rio Grande do Sul (TCE-RS), internal departments relied on manual, paper-based service requests, which resulted in delays, high costs, and a lack of process transparency.

**Task:**  
Design and implement automated workflows to enhance service efficiency, minimize paper usage, and facilitate data traceability.

**Action:**
- Mapped AS-IS and TO-BE business processes in close collaboration with stakeholders.
- Designed and built workflows using Oracle Workflow Builder and PL/SQL.
- Integrated automated flows with legacy systems (e.g., vacation requests, reimbursements, inventory).
- Enabled SLA tracking and performance evaluation through embedded audit checkpoints.

**Result:**  
Automated over 15 key business processes, reducing request cycle time by up to **50%** and eliminating manual steps. Improved data visibility empowered internal audit teams with service indicators, enhancing SLA monitoring.
